.------------::[ v1.0 Release Notes ]::-------------
|
| It is with extreme pride that I present to you all v1.0 of me and my team's 
| English translation patch for "Rainbow Cotton" on the SEGA Dreamcast!  This 
| year (2021) has seen a number of official Cotton releases, including two 
| translation patches (Saturn and Dreamcast).  Hopefully all you fans out there 
| are loving it!  This patch comes to you 100% fully translated, including all
| in-game text, graphics, and even subtitled FMVs!  As a side note, if you're
| skipping all of the cutscenes as you play this game, then you're definitely
| doing it wrong.
|
| I was fortunate enough to work with the same team who helped me make "Sakura 
| Wars: Columns 2" a reality: Natsume38, Chanh Nguyen (Burntends), and 
| Danthrax4.  Natsume38 painstakingly transcribed all the spoken Japanese 
| dialog from the game's 16 FMVs and then took her first pass at translating it 
| all.  She also included timings for each line, too.  After that, Danthrax4 
| and Burntends made their editing passes to further naturalize the English 
| translation and to ensure proper spelling and grammar.
|
| Another individual assisted in a very, very big way, too!  Patrick "TraynoCo" 
| Traynor, who also lent his time to "Sakura Wars: Columns 2", took on the
| monumental task of subtitling all of the FMVs.  For his efforts, I cannot thank
| him enough.  A huge part of delivering an English translation patch for
| "Rainbow Cotton" was subtitling all 16 of the FMVs found throughout the game.
|
| From there, I was able to use SEGA's very own video encoding tool to create the
| final MPEG Sofdec video files (.SFD).  These FMVs were pretty well animated and
| should be quite enjoyable for all of you players as you work your way through
| "Rainbow Cotton".
|
| Our project's last bit of major help came in the form of graphics work from 
| khikari.  In between each level, a series of tiled images is displayed to the 
| player that show a description (in Japanese) of each region, all of which are 
| overlayed with a semi-transparent stamp after the player clears the stage for 
| each region.  In order to translate these images, she had to remove the 
| Japanese text and rebuild the original images by hand.  This required a lot 
| of pixel-by-pixel editing and the end result delivered to me were clean 
| images to which I could add English text.  You'll see how it turned out after 
| clearing each level!  All other graphics in the game were done by me 
| personally.
|
| From a technical perspective, this game didn't pose too much of a challenge.
| It uses what seems to be a random one-off container format called "PLK" for 
| which I wrote an extraction and rebuilding tool.  I included the binary and 
| source code for these tools in this project's GitHub repository.  I'd like to 
| thank esperknight for being the one to originally teach me how to work with
| files like these.  If not for him, I would have been banging my head against
| the wall a lot longer than I did!
|
| Outside of those PLKs, the only odd thing I encountered was some peculiarity 
| with how the headers were stored for both PVR textures and PVM texture 
| containers.  In the end, the solution to my problem with these headers was 
| stupidly simple, but I don't know how long it would have taken me to figure 
| out on my own if not for some help from VincentNL and mrneo240.
|
| Lastly, I want to thank SnowyAria and ItsumoKnight for bits and pieces of 
| translation assistance, whether it be with identifying kanji in image 
| textures, or helping with English localization suggestions.
|
| In closing, my last bit of thanks goes to the fantastic Dreamcast community.  
| Without our collective undying passion for SEGA's swan song console, projects 
| like this one wouldn't exist.  May The Dreamâ„¢ live on for many, many years 
| to come!
|
| PS: There's no way I could have successfully and thoroughly play-tested this
|     patch without the following invincibility code, which is compatible with
|     CodeBreaker and probably all other cheat discs for Dreamcast.  If you just
|     want to experience the story and cutscenes, this one's for you:
